# Machine Learning Working Group Spring 2018

In Spring 2018 MWLG will revisit some traditional algorithms:  

January 31: [k-nearest neighbors    ](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/MachineLearningWG/tree/master/Spring2018/Jan31-knn) 

February 14: decision tree  

February 28: random forest  

March 14: lightning talks  

April 11: gradient boosting  

April 25: elastic net  

May 9: lightning talks  

We are always looking for student/staff/faculty presenters. Please contact us if you are interested! 

[The Fall 2017 folder](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/MachineLearningWG/tree/master/Fall2017) covers some basics of neural networks for image processing. 

[The Spring 2017 folder](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/MachineLearningWG/tree/master/Spring2017) covers: k-nearest neighbor classification and regression, stepwise regression, linear and polynomial regression and polynomial and smoothing splines, multivariate adaptive regression splines and generalized additive models, support vector machines, and introductions to neural networks.

[The Fall 2016 folder](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/MachineLearningWG/tree/master/Fall2016) covers: decision trees, random forests, penalized regression, and boosting.
