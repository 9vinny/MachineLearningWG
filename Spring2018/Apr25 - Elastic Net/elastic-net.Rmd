# Background

Penalized regression is a modification of ordinary least squares (OLS) or
generalized linear models regression (namely logistic regression) to shrink the
estimated coefficients closer to zero. This is because the default estimated
coefficients from linear regression inherently contain some overfitting - they
are incorporating some random noise in the data that will not be the same for
new, unseen data.

Penalization addresses this inherent overfitting by changing the objective
function used to choose the optimal estimated beta coefficients. It says: "I
want to choose beta coefficients that minimize my loss function (often
mean-squared error) but I also don't want the sum of the coefficients to be too large."

There are two types of penalization: L1 (sum of absolute values) or L2 (sum of squared values). L2 penalization was the first type of penalized regression, and is called **ridge regression**. It was first published by Hoerl & Kennard in 1970 and allows regression to be used with there are more covariates than observations (p > n). L1 penalization is called **LASSO** (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) and was first published by Tibshirani in 1996. Lasso has the special property of **sparsity** - it assumes that only a subset of variables are related to the outcome and tends to zero out the coefficients on the least related covariates.

Ridge and lasso can be combined into a single regression called **elastic net**, which takes a weighted average of the L1 and L2 penalties. Elastic net was first published in 2005 by Zou and Hastie; the weighting between L1 and L2 penalties is controlled by the $\alpha$ hyperparamter which ranges between 0 (ridge) and 1 (lasso).

## Data prep

```{r}
library(MASS)
data(Boston)
help(Boston)
str(Boston)
summary(Boston)

# Our outcome is median home value.
outcome = "medv"

# Divide into 80% training, 20% test split.
# NOTE: this is a shortcut; we prefer to use cross-validation for real projects.
library(caret)
set.seed(1)
train_index = caret::createDataPartition(Boston[, outcome], p = .8, 
                                  list = F, 
                                  times = 1)

# Glmnet wants the data to be matrices, not data frames.
X_train = as.matrix(Boston[train_index, !names(Boston) == outcome])
X_test = as.matrix(Boston[-train_index, !names(Boston) == outcome])

Y_train = Boston[train_index, outcome]
Y_test = Boston[-train_index, outcome]

dim(X_train)
length(Y_train)

dim(X_test)
length(Y_test)
```


## Lasso

Lasso penalizes coefficients and imposes sparsity, so some coefficients may be shrunk to 0 if they do not appear to be related to the outcome.

```{r}
library(glmnet)
# Fit the lasso to continuous Y
reg = cv.glmnet(X_train, Y_train, family = "gaussian", alpha = 1)

# Look at distribution of penalty term lambda.
plot(reg)

# Plot the underlying glmnet object, showing
# coefficients for differnt lambda values.
plot(reg$glmnet.fit, xvar = "lambda", label = T)

# Lambda with minimum mean-squared error.
reg$lambda.min

# Higher lambda within 1SE of performance of the minimum.
# (the "one standard error" rule from Leo Breiman.)
reg$lambda.1se

# Review coeffients
coef(reg, s = "lambda.1se")

# What about for lambda.min?
coef(reg, s = "lambda.min")

# Predict on test set.
pred = predict(reg, s = reg$lambda.1se, newx = X_test)

# Calculate mean-squared error.
mean((pred - Y_test)^2)
```

## Ridge

Ridge penalizes the coefficients but does not impose sparsity, so no coefficient will ever be 0.

```{r}

# Fit the ridge to continuous Y
# We just change alpha to 0 to get ridge regression.
reg = cv.glmnet(X_train, Y_train, family = "gaussian", alpha = 0)

# Look at distribution of penalty term lambda.
plot(reg)

# Plot the underlying glmnet object, showing
# coefficients for differnt lambda values.
plot(reg$glmnet.fit, xvar = "lambda", label = T)

# Predict on test set.
pred = predict(reg, s = reg$lambda.1se, newx = X_test)

# Calculate mean-squared error.
mean((pred - Y_test)^2)
```

As expected, we do a little worse with ridge compared to lasso.

## Elastic net

```{r}
train_control = trainControl(method = "repeatedCV",
                             number = 10,
                             repeats = 3)

set.seed(1)

# Create a custom tuning grid.
enet_grid = expand.grid(alpha = seq(0, 1, length.out = 5),
                        lambda = 2^seq(-1, -7, length = 5))

# Review the grid.
enet_grid

# To be simpler we could just say e.g. tuneLength = 5.

enet = train(X_train, Y_train, method = "glmnet",
             #tuneLength = 5,
             tuneGrid = enet_grid,
             trControl = train_control)

print(enet)

plot(enet)

enet$bestTune

# Predict on test.
pred = predict(enet, X_test)

# Review performance
mean((pred - Y_test)^2)
```

## SuperLearner

```{r}
library(SuperLearner)

enet = create.Learner("SL.glmnet",
                      tune = list(alpha = c(0, 0.1, 0.5, 0.9, 1.0)),
                      detailed_names = TRUE)

sl_lib = c("SL.mean", "SL.lm", "SL.stepAIC", enet$names, "SL.ranger")

set.seed(1, "L'Ecuyer-CMRG") 

# This will take a few minutes to execute - take a look at the .html file to see the output!
cv_sl = CV.SuperLearner(Y = Y_train, X = data.frame(X_train), verbose = TRUE,
                        SL.library = sl_lib, family = gaussian(),
                        cvControl = list(V = 10L))

summary(cv_sl)

plot(cv_sl) + theme_bw()

# devtools::install_github("ck37/ck37r")
# library(ck37r)
