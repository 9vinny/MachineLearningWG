### Dataset
We will be using [The Nature Convervancy Fisheries Monitoring dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/the-nature-conservancy-fisheries-monitoring) for the walkthroughs this semester. 

### Schedule
Alternating Fridays 9/8 to 12/15 from 12:30-00pm in the D-Lab Convening Room (356B Barrows). 

- September 8: BRC Savio lightning talk, introduction, resources, dataset; feed forward and deep feed forward neural networks

- September 22: Benten lightning talk(?); convolutional neural networks
